## Useful analytics 

### Player population

- Players with 30+ days of inactivity
- Quest completion rate (no one doing quest = wasted dev money)

### Currency inflation
- Gold generated vs gold destroyed
- Player wealth distribution (too high a wealth distribution is bad for eco)

### Player progress
- Total level distribution (is everyone skilling)
- Combat level distribution (if everyone is maxed, then you have to keep adding end-game content)
