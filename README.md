# Moonlight | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luna-rs/luna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/notjuanortiz.moonlight) [![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/510259198605525007.svg)](https://discord.gg/udCqykV) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lare96/luna/master/LICENSE.txt)

The Moonlight Framework is an open source framework for building old-school Runescape emulators.

Moonlight is a "heavily" modified fork of [Luna](https://github.com/luna-rs/luna) with a modern twist.

# Goals
- Secure and resilient server-client communication
- Plug-and-play revision support
- Support for data access systems such as RDBMS, NoSQL, as well as local file storage for servers of any size.
- Extensible support for access-control. Making custom rules for development teams and staff has never been easier.

# Non-goals
- This project will not include any combat-related data such as weapon attributes, equipment attributes, and/or damage(s) dealt using those attributes.
- This project will not include experience gains for any stat, although it may provide support for those operations.
- This project will not include multi-revision support.
- This project will not include custom content such as minigames, bosses, or maps that do not appear in earlier revisions.

# Getting started
Unfortunately there is still a ton of work to be done before this project is usable but, until then feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/waiting-room). 

# Special thanks to
- The team behind the [Luna](https://github.com/luna-rs/luna) project, for providing critical components and guidance.
